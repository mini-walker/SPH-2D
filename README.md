# SPH (Smooth-particle Hydrodynamic)

## 1. üìò About This Code
These Fortran codes were developed during my master's study. The solver is based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for solving the **weakly compressible Navier‚ÄìStokes equations**.

### 1.1 ‚ú® Features
- Parallelization:
  - MPI (Message Passing Interface)
  - OpenMP (shared memory parallelism)

- Supports various boundary conditions:

  - Non-reflecting boundary condition

  - Wave generation

  - Wave damping zone

  - Periodic boundaries

  - Inlet/outlet boundaries

  - No-slip and free-slip wall boundaries

- Output formats:

  - Tecplot (Binary / ASCII)

  - ParaView (VTK)

### 1.2 üéØ Purpose
This code is intended as a learning tool for students and researchers interested in SPH methods.
Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from it.

Hope it helps you in your SPH journey!
